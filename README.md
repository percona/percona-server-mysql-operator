[Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona Server for MySQL](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html) automates the creation and management of highly available, enterprise-ready MySQL database clusters on Kubernetes.

[Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona Server for MySQL](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html) follows our best practices for deployment and configuration of highly-available, fault-tolerant MySQL instances in a Kubernetes-based environment on-premises or in the cloud. It provides the following capabilities:

* Deploy group replication MySQL clusters with MySQL Router
* Deploy asynchronous replication MySQL clusters with Orchestrator and HAProxy
* Expose clusters with regular Kubernetes Services
* Monitor the cluster with [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
* Customize MySQL configuration
* Manage system user passwords


## Status

**This project is in the tech preview state right now. Don't use it on production.**

As of today, we recommend using [Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/pxc/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

## Architecture

Percona Operators are based on the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and leverage Kubernetes primitives to follow best CNCF practices.

## Documentation

To learn more about the Operator, check the [Percona Operator for MySQL documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html).

# Quickstart installation

Ready to try out the Operator? Check the [Quickstart tutorials](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/helm.html) for easy-to follow steps. 

Below is one of the ways to deploy the Operator using `kubectl`.

## kubectl

1. Deploy the Operator from `deploy/bundle.yaml`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-server-mysql-operator/main/deploy/bundle.yaml
```

2. Deploy the database cluster itself from `deploy/cr.yaml`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-server-mysql-operator/main/deploy/cr.yaml

```
