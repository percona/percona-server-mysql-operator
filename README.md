[Percona Server for MySQL](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) is a free, fully compatible, enhanced, and open source drop-in replacement for any MySQL database. It provides superior performance, scalability, and instrumentation.

Based on our best practices for deployment and configuration, [Percona Operator for MySQL](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html) contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL instances in a Kubernetes-based environment on-premises or in the cloud. It provides the following capabilities:

* Deploy asynchronous and semi-sync replication MySQL clusters with Orchestrator on top of it
* Expose clusters with regular Kubernetes Services
* Monitor the cluster with [Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
* Customize MySQL configuration
* Manage system user passwords

## Status

**This project is in the tech preview state right now. Don't use it on production.**

As of today, we recommend using [Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/pxc/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

## Roadmap

We have an experimental public roadmap which can be found [here](https://github.com/percona/roadmap/projects/1). Please feel free to contribute and propose new features by following the roadmap [guidelines](https://github.com/percona/roadmap).

## Architecture

Percona Operators are based on the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and leverage Kubernetes primitives to follow best CNCF practices.

## Installation

It usually takes two steps to deploy Percona Server for MySQL on Kubernetes:

* Deploy the operator from `deploy/bundle.yaml`
* Deploy the database cluster itself from `deploy/cr.yaml`

See full documentation with examples and various advanced cases on [percona.com](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html).
