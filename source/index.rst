Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator
========================================================

Kubernetes have added a way to
manage containerized systems, including database clusters. This management is
achieved by controllers, declared in configuration files. These controllers
provide automation with the ability to create objects, such as a container or a
group of containers called pods, to listen for an specific event and then
perform a task.

This automation adds a level of complexity to the container-based architecture
and stateful applications, such as a database. A Kubernetes Operator is a
special type of controller introduced to simplify complex deployments. The
Operator extends the Kubernetes API with custom resources.

`Percona Server for MySQL <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/index.html>`_
is a free, fully compatible, enhanced, and open source drop-in replacement for
any MySQL database. It provides superior performance, scalability, and
instrumentation.
Based on our best practices for deployment and configuration, `Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mysql-operator>`_
contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL
instances in a Kubernetes-based environment on-premises or in the cloud.
