Changing MySQL Options
======================

You may require a configuration change for your application. MySQL
allows the option to configure the database with a configuration file.
You can pass options from the
`my.cnf <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html>`__
configuration file to be included in the MySQL configuration in one of the
following ways:

* edit the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file,
* use a ConfigMap,
* use a Secret object.

Edit the ``deploy/cr.yaml`` file
---------------------------------

You can add options from the
`my.cnf <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html>`__
configuration file by editing the configuration section of the
``deploy/cr.yaml``. Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   spec:
     secretsName: cluster1-secrets
     mysql:
       ...
         configuration: |
           max_connections=250

See the `Custom Resource options, MySQL section <operator.html#operator-mysql-section>`_
for more details.

.. _operator-configmaps-cm:

Use a ConfigMap
---------------

You can use a configmap and the cluster restart to reset configuration
options. A configmap allows Kubernetes to pass or update configuration
data inside a containerized application.

Use the ``kubectl`` command to create the configmap from external
resources, for more information see `Configure a Pod to use a
ConfigMap <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#create-a-configmap>`__.

For example, letâ€™s suppose that your application requires more
connections. To increase your ``max_connections`` setting in MySQL, you
define a ``my.cnf`` configuration file with the following setting:

::

   max_connections=250

You can create a configmap from the ``my.cnf`` file with the
``kubectl create configmap`` command.

You should use the combination of the cluster name with the ``-mysql``
suffix as the naming convention for the configmap. To find the cluster
name, you can use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl get ps

The syntax for ``kubectl create configmap`` command is:

::

   kubectl create configmap <cluster-name>-mysql <resource-type=resource-name>

The following example defines ``cluster1-mysql`` as the configmap name and the
``my.cnf`` file as the data source:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl create configmap cluster1-mysql --from-file=my.cnf

To view the created configmap, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   kubectl describe configmaps cluster1-mysql

.. _operator-configmaps-secret:

Use a Secret Object
-------------------

The Operator can also store configuration options in `Kubernetes Secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_.
This can be useful if you need additional protection for some sensitive data.

You should create a Secret object with a specific name, composed of your cluster
name and the ``mysql`` suffix.
  
.. note:: To find the cluster name, you can use the following command:

   .. code:: bash

      $ kubectl get ps

Configuration options should be put inside a specific key inside of the ``data``
section. The name of this key is ``my.cnf`` for Percona Server for MySQL pods.

Actual options should be encoded with `Base64 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>`_.

For example, let's define a ``my.cnf`` configuration file and put there a pair
of MySQL options we used in the previous example:

::

   max_connections=250

You can get a Base64 encoded string from your options via the command line as
follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ cat my.cnf | base64

.. note:: Similarly, you can read the list of options from a Base64 encoded
   string:

   .. code:: bash

      $ echo "bWF4X2Nvbm5lY3Rpb25zPTI1MAo" | base64 --decode

Finally, use a yaml file to create the Secret object. For example, you can
create a ``deploy/mysql-secret.yaml`` file with the following contents:

.. code:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: cluster1-mysql
   data:
     my.cnf: "bWF4X2Nvbm5lY3Rpb25zPTI1MAo"

When ready, apply it with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl create -f deploy/mysql-secret.yaml

.. note:: Do not forget to restart Percona Server for MySQL pods to ensure the
   cluster has updated the configuration. You can do it with the following
   command: 
   
   .. code:: bash

      $ kubectl rollout restart statefulset cluster1-mysql
