.. note:: Version 0.2.0 of the `Percona Operator for MySQL <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mysql-operator>`_ is **a tech preview release** and it is **not recommended for production environments**. **As of today, we recommend using** `Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster <https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html>`_, which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.
